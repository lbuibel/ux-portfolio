                        <p class="body-text">The approach to this project was a little different than most I’ve worked on, being it was more focused on creating a user experience that was adaptive to different types of media platforms rather than just development and design. Deciding what platforms a product will live on, and how it will change on each of these platforms will depend greatly on the type of product you’re developing and what services each platform does well. Understanding each platform is key when creating a good user experience on different media channels.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h1 class="section-heading">Product Goal</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">Before strategizing how the product would meet its users, it was important to nail down what the product was and what its features would be. The main goal of Off The Slopes was to provide ski info that both helped people get into the sport and stay up to date on gear and conditions, primarily for people based in Utah</p>
                </div>


                <div class="container">
                    <h2 class="section-subheading">High Level Strategy</h2>
                    <p class="body-text">The first step for this project was working out which media platforms best meet the users needs for a skiing platform. Four were decided on: a social media channel, a mobile app, a website, as well as a podcast.</p>

                <div>
                    <h1 class="section-heading">Channel One: Social Media - Picking a platform</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">Community engagement and product overlap played the biggest role in deciding what platform would best suit the product. Knowing that there was a mobile app and website coming down the road was important in that it helped frame what was important to accomplish with the social media channel. Having something that was light and gave users a brief view of who the company is, along with ski updates were two of the main goals for the social media channel.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="body-text">Instagram felt like the right fit to accomplish those two things rather than Facebook or Twitter. It still offers a form of engagement with users with comments, and is a good place for more casual updates and posts that might not be necessary on the website or app. </p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">Channel Two: Mobile App</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">The main goal when designing the app was to create something that would be a part of peoples “getting ready” process when planning a trip or a day skiing. Something most skiers that I know do, is check the conditions the night before or as they are heading up. This is fine and all if you just have one resort you’re checking, but what if you wanted to check a few?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="block-img img-fade">
                    <img src="assets/images/off-the-slopes/app-example.png" alt="zion app: saving trails example">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="body-text">Above you’ll see an example of what the “Snow Report” page will look like. At the top you’ll have a dropdown where you can pick the resort you want to view, giving users the ability to quickly view a few resorts all in one place, rather than checking multiple websites.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="body-text">There is also a “Gear” page where users can view reviews on new gear. Realistically that will be used more so one users have spare time and want to geek out  on new stuff at the beginning of the season. The snow report page will be the “meat and potatoes” of the app.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-subheading">How the app fits into the Off the Slopes Ecosystem</h2>
                    <p class="body-text">The app gives a place for everything to live in one place. The instagram page doesn’t really grant access to the website or podcast outside of a link in the bio, and doesn’t really provide great updates on weather. The app gives people access to everything; they can listen to the podcast, view the gear talked about on the podcast, and check out the snow conditions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="body-text">There’s a chance that people may listen to the podcast on something like Spotify, but just like being able to view the snow reports easily, viewing the gear from the podcast is now made easy, giving people more of a reason to view/listen to content on the app.</p>

                <div>
                    <h1 class="section-heading">Channel Three: The website</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">The final channel is a website for Off The Slopes which has similar architecture to the app but with one exception, the gear page. On the app, the gear page just contains articles with our latest reviews, which for the most part be aligned with the podcast. On the website, the gear page will have a feature called “Gear Comparison” where users can search for certain gear items to compare them before making a purchase. Typically skiers will have a few options they’re comparing/thinking about before making a purchase, so this will give them good place to see pros/cons of certain gear.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-subheading">Why on desktop and not mobile?</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="body-text"><br>1) Depending how how many things people are trying to compare, it might get a little busy or overly complex to display it well on mobile. Using the desktop platform for this feature will be a better overall experience for our users
                        </li>
                        <li class="body-text"><br>2) The app is more centered on user updates, becoming a part of their “getting ready” routing before skiing. The website will be more apt at helping users making informed decisions when picking out gear.</li>
                        <li class="body-text"><br>3) A desktop platform can meet users in the right time and right place. Contrary to what most bosses/companies think, free time at work on the computer can often be spent looking at hobby related things. Phones may not be appropriate in the settings, but computers are. </li>

                <div>
                    <h1 class="section-heading">How a website fits with the platform.</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">Unlike the podcast and app and social media page, the website can house a wide variety of information and features. I think the social media page will mostly be for people who want to see what we’re up to, the podcast will mostly likely be viewed on other platforms like Spotify, and the app will mostly geared towards people getting ready to ski. The website helps round out our platforms with something geared towards users sitting down and spending more time to review gear. I think it also gives us a good place to grow too, if we ever wanted to sell sell gear etc. this would give us the place to do it.</p>

                <p class="body-text">Before starting this project, I never really considered how much planning is required to create a good user experience hosting a product on different media channels. Having a unique yet different enough experience on each channel to not have redundancy isn’t that just happens by accident.</p>
