                <p class="body-text">Like with most large scope projects, proper management and planning plays a huge roll in the success of the final product. At UVU I spent a year working on a team project with clients that had the goal of starting a foundation that would help out local musicians develop their business and music skills to help take the next step in their music careers. </p>

                <p class="body-text">Starting from scratch meant not only designing and developing a website, but also planning out what features would help the foundation get off the ground as well.</p>

A foundation can provide the means for people to achieve their goals and meet others in the music industry.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="body-text">Raise money to build a facility</li>

                        <p class="body-text">Luckily our clients had a lot of info for us to work with when it came to planning out who their target audience was. We decided it would be a good idea to limit our targeted audience or personas down to three people to keep things focused. Each persona represented someone that the foundation we be working with wether it was musicians, students or potential donors.</p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">Structure and Hierarchy</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">Now that we had a rough idea of the goals of the website, along with who the audience was, the next step was to start building site maps and wireframes to plan out the structure of the site. We wanted to get a sense of what specific pages would be needed for the site, as well as what info would make the most sense on each page.</p>
                    <div class="block-img img-fade">

                    </div>
                    <p class="body-text">Since the foundation was just getting started, the goal was to make donations a key aspect of the site. As far as the hierarch totem pole goes, donations was meant be right at the top along with displaying who the foundations was and what they’re planning.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h1 class="section-heading">Website Phases</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">It became pretty clear early on that there would need to be different phases of the website being that the goals needed to be accomplished loosely in order. An example of this is the online store which sells local artists merchandise. Without having the foundation up and running, or having products to list on the store, it didn’t make a whole lot of sense to create a store right off the bat.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="body-text">We ended up planning on three phases for the site which each focused on different goals of the foundation.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">So far everything had been moving quite smooth with the project, we had a good idea of what they were trying to accomplish, who our target audience was, and how the website should be implemented. Now was the time to get in and start building the website based on the plan which had been laid out.</p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">Anticipating Changes</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">Being this was the first time working with an actual client for many of the members on the team, something a lot of us didn’t foresee was the clients desire to make changes or updates to the site after the development phase had started. At first it didn’t seem like anything to worry about, but quickly got out of hand. Pushing back on the clients to not make so many changes seemed difficult at the time but may have benefited the project looking back on it… more on this later.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">One way we could have helped keep the project more on course would have been to set clearer expectations with our client, and ourselves earlier on in the project. A good way of accomplishing this would have been setting tasks and objectives at the begging of our weekly meetings to keep everything on topic, as well as more clearly defined bench marks for the site to mark its progress.</p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">Focusing on the project goal</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">Originally the plan we set out on was to focus on phase one of the website, making sure that was fully realized and thought out before moving onto phase two or three. After some derailment, the new plan was to build all three phases of the site so everything was ready to go from day one, and phases could be added to the site at the clients discretion.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="body-text">In theory, a setup where the client has everything at their fingertips right off the bat is great, but may not be super practical in the long term. In reality it may be a year, if not several before anything like a store needs to be implemented or in used on the site at which time may have different requirements than what we built.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h1 class="section-heading">Why this is important</h1>
                    <p class="body-text">With how competitive the digital media space is, we needed to not only create a site that met our users needs, but was something that kept users engaged and interested. Had the scope of the project been kept in individual phases, more time could have been spent focusing on delivering a product that excelled at what we were trying to offer users, rather than worrying about getting everything in before the deadline</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="body-text">Getting caught in the weeds early on, worrying about adding extra features in some ways watered down the potency of the site. Yes it has the features the client was looking for, but doesn’t deliver them in a meaningful rememberable way to the users.</p>

                <h1 class="section-heading">Key takeaways</h1>
                <p class="body-text">I learned a lot over the course of this project, primarily about the dynamic of working with a client and a team. Learning when and when not to push back as a developer & designer is important and at times uncomfortable, but ultimately can be beneficial for you, the project and the client being that it could mean the final product is more in line with what’s achievable and meets the clients needs.</p>
