                    <p class="body-text">In a recent project at UVU, we were tasked with coming up with the ideation and development of an app that could be used at a local national park. This would involve building site maps and wireframes, along with a functional prototype for our app with the goal of educating, informing and engaging those interested in visiting the national park of our choice.</p>
                </div>

                        <h1 class="section-heading">App Goal</h1>
                        <p class="body-text">The purpose of this app is to provide park visitors and soon to be visitors of Zion National Park a place to learn how to navigate their way around to different trail heads via the parks provided shuttle services.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="body-text">To help achieve this goal, the driving section of the app would be the “trails” page, which gives users the ability to filter trails from easy, moderate and strenuous, depending on what kind of hike they are wanting to do.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="block-img img-fade">

                    <!-- TODO add image caption -->
                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p class="body-text">While viewing trails based on difficulty, users have the option to both view the shuttle stop for that specific trail, as well as favorite that trail/hike for later. These two features help users  trying to navigate their way around while at the park, as well as plan their trip before hand by saving trails they like.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">Users could access the shuttle map page via each individual trail card, as well as the “shuttle” button within the footer navigation. The choice to add the shuttle page to the navigation was based on the fact that this page would more than likely need to be viewed on its own rather than through a certain trail card.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="body-text">One of the constraints of the shuttle page is the lack of additional maps provided by the park. Ideally there would be multiple maps to pull info from when showing users certain stops for certain trail heads. This would need to be developed in correspondence with the park to avoid users only being taking to one generic map.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">Users have a couple options when it comes to saving trails on the app. First is the download option, which can be found at the top of the trail page. Reason for this feature and why it’s important stems from the likelihood of users losing cell service while visiting the park. Downloading the trails lets them view all the necessary trail info irregardless if they have service.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="body-text">The second option to save trails is to favorite them by clicking the heart icon at the top of the trail card which adds them to their favorites list. Doing this will require signing up for an account on the app, but will be a nice feature for visitors planning a trip. To access their account, users can click the profile icon on the top right corner of the app to login and view their profile.</p>

Additional features could be added, but the goal was to keep it simple and lightweight to provide easy use for those at the park.</p>

The hamburger navigation took users to a secondary navigation page as seen to the right. This was removed to make room for user login page and to get rid of redundancy. Where the hamburger button once was, now sits the button/icon to allow users to login.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">Each card will be templated to have the same setup, showing the full description and trailhead location. In the event that the description is really short, the only thing shown after expanding would be the trailhead location.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">Building this app taught me a lot when it comes to having consistent structure from page to page, namely with the park info page. Dropping users strait into the info page was a little jarring, there needed to be another step to give users a better sense of where they were and how to navigate that page.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="body-text">Similar things came up throughout the process of building this, like giving users the ability to filter the trails and add them their profile.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="body-text">Even a simple app like this can require a lot of decision making and iterations to really nail down the design.</p>
